        <p>I am a Product Designer, Graphics and Frontend Developer with a background in Law</p>

        <p>Every design process begins with a research, you do that by collating the feel,say and like of your potential users from your research. UX is however the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product, when a user finds it difficult to navigate around a particular product or website or App then that is a bad UX. User Experience Design is all about designing specifically for the needs of the user or customer. Anybody that has the combination skill of both UI and UX is called a Product Designer.
